### Scraping the Synthetic Risk and Reward Indicator (SRRI) from Key Information Documents (KIDs)

This repository contains my statistics bachelor thesis that revolves around scraping funds' key information documents. The full text can be found [here](https://github.com/Base-R-Best-R/KID/blob/main/Bachelor%20Thesis%20(Statistics)/Bachelor_Thesis_KIDs.pdf).

### Abstract

The main objective of this paper is to extract the SRRI (Synthetic
Risk and Reward Indicator) from fundsâ€™ KIDs (Key Information Documents). Two approaches are presented, the naive approach which does not
rely on any statistical methods and the clustering approach, which utilizes
hierarchical agglomerative clustering. The naive approach manages to correctly predict 80% of the test cases while the clustering approach performs
worse at an accuracy of 70%. Both methods do not generate any incorrectly
predicted cases, i.e., the result for the sample at hand is either a correct
readout or an error. This is a crucial performance characteristic, as misclassified cases that do not result in an error are only observable if the files
are opened and checked manually.
